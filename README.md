# Files_google_replica
In this app I am trying to make a replica of Files app by Google

When you open the app it will show options wheather the user wants to open videos, audios, images, documents, internal storage files.
then the permission will be asked by the app.
If the user gives the permission then it will show all the files related to that field.
User can sort all of them using the menu options given above
User can also select does he wants to see data in grid format or list format.

if the user opens the images and select any one the image then a new activity will open showing that image and that activity consists of viewPager2.
If the user opens the audio and select any audio then new activity will open which will play that audio using exoPlayer and same goes for video files.
User can also see the PDF files and the pdf file will get rendered in the form of images.

User can also delete the file, share the file, check details of the file using buttons given at the bottom.
